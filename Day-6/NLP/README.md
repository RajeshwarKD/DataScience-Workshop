# ðŸ§  NLP Breakout Session â€“ Data Science Workshop

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Breakout Session** on **Day 6** of the **Data Analytics and Visualization Workshop**!  
This repository contains all the materials â€” presentations, tutorials, and example notebooks â€” for you to **dive into the world of NLP**, from fundamentals to modern LLMs.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn

In this hands-on session, you will explore how machines understand and process human language. We'll start from traditional techniques and move toward the latest in deep learning and large language models.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction to Traditional NLP
- What is NLP and why it matters
- Text preprocessing pipeline: normalization, stopwords, stemming, lemmatization
- Basic NLP tasks and use cases

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Tokenization and POS Tagging
- Sentence and word tokenization
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and grammatical structures
- Hands-on with spaCy and NLTK

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Word Embeddings
- From One-Hot Encoding to Word2Vec and GloVe
- Understanding context with embeddings
- Visualizing semantic similarity in embeddings

### ðŸ”¹ 4. NLP with Machine Learning
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words)
- Text classification using traditional ML (Naive Bayes, SVM)

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Deep Learning for NLP
- Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTMs
- How sequence models understand language
- Sentiment analysis with LSTMs

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Transformers and Modern NLP
- Why transformers replaced RNNs
- Architecture basics: attention, encoder-decoder
- Applications of transformers (BERT, GPT, etc.)

### ðŸ”¹ 7. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering
- What are LLMs (like llama, ChatGPT etc)
- How to use LLMs via APIs and open-source tools
- Basics of **Prompt Engineering{https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/graph }** for real-world applications
